# Serverless LEAVE

Implement a simple LEAVE application using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework. 
# Functionality of the application

This application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching LEAVE items. Each LEAVE item can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to LEAVE items that he/she has created.

# LEAVE items

The application should store LEAVE items, and each LEAVE item contains the following fields:

* `finishId` (string) - a unique id for an item
* `createdAt` (string) - date and time when an item was created
* `name` (string) - name of a LEAVE item (e.g. "Vacation, Sick, Short Term Disability, etc")
* `finishDate` (string) - date of leave
* `hours` (int) - hours of this leave
* `attachmentUrl` (string) (optional) - a URL pointing to an image attached to a LEAVE item

You might also store an id of a user who created a LEAVE item.
